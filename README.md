## Develop

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies and `yarn start` to start the local server.

## Scripts

Some useful custom scripts are :

- `test` => runs tests 🧪
- `eslint-check` => checks if there are any configuration problems between `prettier` and `eslint` rules
- `lint` => runs linter (`eslint`)
- `flow` => runs `flowjs` for typechecking
- `flow:coverage` => checks for `flowjs` coverage
- `flow:stop` => stops `flowjs` server
- `flow:typed` => installs `flowtype` def for dependencies

There are many other, so just run `yarn run` to see all available scripts.
